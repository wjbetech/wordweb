## üé® Design Philosophy

**Simplicity**: Complex functionality should feel simple
**Clarity**: Visual hierarchy guides user attention
**Responsiveness**: Immediate feedback to all interactions
**Beauty**: Aesthetic design enhances usability

## üß≠ Decision Framework

When making project decisions, ask:

1. **Does this serve our core purpose** of semantic exploration?
2. **Will this improve the user experience** without adding complexity?
3. **Is this technically sound** and maintainable?
4. **Does this align** with our design philosophy?
