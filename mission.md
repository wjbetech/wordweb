## üöÄ Overhead, SEO, and Polish Improvements (Backlog)

### 1. SEO & Social

- Add a `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` for better search engine indexing.
- Use a unique, branded favicon (not the default Vite icon).
- Add a canonical URL meta tag.
- Set a language attribute (`<html lang="en">` is good, but ensure it's correct for your audience).

### 2. Accessibility

- Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links) have accessible labels and keyboard navigation.
- Add `aria-label` or `aria-*` attributes where needed.
- Check color contrast for accessibility.

### 3. Performance

- Add a `<meta name="theme-color" ...>` for mobile browser theming.
- Use `preconnect` or `dns-prefetch` for external APIs or fonts.
- Optimize images and SVGs (favicon, Open Graph image).

### 4. PWA/Installability

- Add a `manifest.json` for Progressive Web App support (installable on mobile).
- Add a service worker for offline support (optional, but Vite makes this easy).

### 5. Analytics & Monitoring

- Add Google Analytics, Plausible, or another privacy-friendly analytics tool.
- Set up error monitoring (e.g., Sentry) for production.

### 6. User Experience

- Add a loading spinner or skeleton for slow network/API responses.
- Add a "Share" button for social media or direct link sharing.
- Add a "Feedback" or "Contact" link for user suggestions or bug reports.
- Add a "Back to Top" button for long pages.

### 7. Code & Dev Experience

- Add a `README.md` with setup, usage, and contribution instructions.
- Add a `LICENSE` file if you plan to open source.
- Set up automated linting/formatting (Prettier, ESLint).
- Add basic tests (unit or integration) for key components.

### 8. Branding & Trust

- Add a footer with copyright, privacy policy, and terms.
- Add your logo and a short tagline.
- Add a "Powered by React Flow" or similar credit if required by license.

# üéØ wordweb. Project Mission

> **Vision**: Create an intuitive, beautiful, and powerful visual word association tool that helps users explore language connections, brainstorm ideas, and discover semantic relationships through interactive graph visualization.

## ‚úÖ Status Update ‚Äî August 2025

- Completed recently:
  - ‚ÄúSurprise me‚Äù random word search
  - ‚ÄúReturn to Core Word‚Äù navigation button
  - Local named saves with Save/Load modals (DaisyUI)
  - Dual-word experiment removed + storage cleanup
  - Edge-cursor fix; major refactor; consistent modal styling
- In progress:
  - Improve Load: hydrate state without full page reload
  - Export/Import JSON of wordwebs
- Next steps (priority):
  1. Hydrate saved state in-app (no reload) by adding a hydrate function in `WordWebFlow` and calling it from `Sidebar`
  2. Export/Import JSON for wordwebs
  3. PNG/SVG export via ReactFlow utilities
  4. Optional: default save-name heuristic (center word + timestamp)

## üé™ Core Purpose

## üí° Technical Implementation Notes

### TypeScript Standards

- **Zero `any` Policy**: All types must be explicitly defined in `/types` directory
- **Type Organization**: Logical grouping of interfaces, types, and enums
- **Strict Configuration**: Enable strictest TypeScript compiler options
- **Runtime Type Validation**: Consider implementing runtime type checking for API responses

### State Management Strategy

- **Current**: React hooks + custom state management
- **Evolution Path**: Migrate to Zustand for centralized, performant state management
- **Immediate**: Use `localStorage` for graph state persistence across sessions
- **Future**: Migrate to IndexedDB or backend solution for robust project management
- **Node Tracking**: Maintain expanded/locked/deleted states per node ID

### API & Caching Architecture

- **Current**: Direct fetch calls to Datamuse API
- **Upgrade**: Implement React Query or SWR for intelligent caching
- **Future**: Custom backend aggregating multiple semantic data sources
- **Performance**: Predictive pre-fetching and offline-first approach

### User Experience Patterns

- **Duplicate Prevention**: Track clicked nodes, show subtle visual indicators for "used" states
- **Loading Feedback**: Implement loading states at both node and application level
- **Error Recovery**: Handle API failures gracefully, maintain user context

### DaisyUI Theme Implementation

- Leverage DaisyUI's built-in theme system with proper CSS custom properties
- Implement theme persistence in localStorage
- Ensure consistent theme application across all components

### Performance Considerations

- **API Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff for 500-level errors
- **Node Interactions**: Optimize drag/drop with RAF-based animations
- **Memory Management**: Clean up unused nodes, implement virtual rendering for large graphs

## üé® Design Philosophy

**Simplicity**: Complex functionality should feel simple **Clarity**: Visual hierarchy guides user attention **Responsiveness**: Immediate feedback to all interactions **Beauty**: Aesthetic design enhances usability

## üõ†Ô∏è Edge Case Work

As we build wordweb., we need to handle various edge cases that could impact user experience or system stability:

### Input Validation & Limits

- [ ] **Handle Long Inputs**: Decide on maximum input length for search terms and implement proper validation
  - Consider UI feedback for character limits
  - Handle truncation vs. rejection of overly long inputs
  - Ensure API compatibility with input length restrictions

### Data & Performance Edge Cases

- [ ] **Empty API Responses**: Handle cases where Datamuse returns no results
- [ ] **Network Failures**: Implement retry logic and offline state handling
- [ ] **Memory Constraints**: Prevent infinite node expansion that could crash the browser
- [ ] **Malformed API Data**: Validate and sanitize all API responses

### User Interaction Edge Cases

- [ ] **Rapid Clicking**: Prevent double-clicks and rapid node expansion requests
- [ ] **Invalid Search Terms**: Handle special characters, emojis, and non-standard input
- [ ] **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure graceful degradation across different browsers
- [ ] **Mobile Touch Events**: Handle touch conflicts with drag/zoom operations

## üß≠ Decision Framework

When making project decisions, ask:

1. **Does this serve our core purpose** of semantic exploration?
2. **Will this improve the user experience** without adding complexity?
3. **Is this technically sound** and maintainable?
4. **Does this align** with our design philosophy?
