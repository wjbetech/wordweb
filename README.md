# WordWeb

Welcome to wordweb. — a playful, visual, and interactive way to explore the world of words and their connections. This app is a personal project born out of a love for language, curiosity, and a desire to make word discovery feel like an adventure.

Friends in marketing have confirmed that it would be great as a tool for snappily building word maps for new products that can inspire new ideation.

Friends in teaching (and myself) have confirmed that it's a powerful vocabulary building tool that children can engage with, and the print to PDF functionality is a great tool for making homework!

## What is WordWeb?

At it's core, wordweb. is a web application that lets you build and explore a "web" of related words. Type in any word, and watch as a network of connections blooms around it — synonyms, related terms, and more, all beautifully visualized. Click on any node to expand the web further, revealing new branches and surprising associations.

## Features

- **Interactive Word Graph:** Visualize words and their relationships as a dynamic, draggable network.
- **Expandable Nodes:** Click any word to expand its connections and grow your web.
- **Tooltip Definitions:** Right-click a node to pin the tooltip and click 'show' to get grammar and meaning information for that word.
- **Colorful, Accessible UI:** Designed for clarity and fun, with accessibility in mind.
- **Onboarding & Help:** Friendly onboarding modal and sidebar to guide new users.
- **Responsive Design:** Works great on desktop and mobile.
- **Powered by Datamuse:** All word data comes from the amazing [Datamuse API](https://www.datamuse.com/api/). They have done an excellent job building this API and have very kindly affirmed my idea and are willing to bump API calls if needed.

## How to Use

1. **Start with a word:** Enter any word in the search bar and hit enter.
2. **Explore:** Click on any node to expand and discover related words.
3. **Navigate:** Drag nodes around, zoom, and pan to explore your word web.
4. **Reset:** Want to start over? Just search for a new word!

## Why I Built This

I am generally interested in visualisation, shapes and canvasing in applications. I also understand what it's like to have writer's block (with music, or code) and a good friend in marketing validated the idea for a very fast brainstorm/prototyping tool early on and made the decision to build this very easy. Since then I have had great feedback from other friends in other fields such as teaching and writing!

## Shoutout: Datamuse API
